Weight Based Shipping is a flexible and widely-used solution to calculate shipping costs based on the total cart weight and value.

== Description ==

Weight Based Shipping is a flexible and widely-used solution for sites using WooCommerce that allows store owners to calculate shipping costs based on the weight and value of the products in the cart. It offers various customization options to set shipping rules based on different conditions, enabling tailored shipping rates for different customer needs and scenarios.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
= Tiered weight-based rates for weight ranges =
<p></p>
Weight Based Shipping allows creating incremental shipping costs based on defined weight ranges. For example, you can set a specific rate for orders up to 5 kg, a higher rate for 5–10 kg, and another rate for weights above 10 kg. This structure enables you to charge progressively more as the package weight increases, offering a fair and predictable pricing model that matches shipping costs to the weight of the items.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
= Free shipping over a threshold =
<p></p>
Offer free shipping once an order reaches a specific threshold, such as a minimum cart total or a minimum/maximum weight. For example, you might provide free shipping on orders over $50 or on packages weighing more than 20 kg. This approach encourages customers to buy more to qualify for free shipping, boosting average order value while keeping lighter, smaller orders cost-effective.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
= Shipping classes [Pro] =
<p></p>
Shipping classes support provides flexibility in configuring shipping rates for your products. You can set up custom shipping rates for specific product groups — frozen, fragile, bulky, drop-shipped, etc. Additionally, you have the option to offer free shipping for selected products or exclude certain items from free shipping. The feature also allows you to enable or disable specific shipping methods on a per-product basis.

= 2.2.1 =

Allow zero weight shipping. Thus, only Handling Fee is added to the final price.

Previously, weight based shipping option has not been shown to user if total weight of their cart is zero. Since version 2.2.1 this is changed so shipping option is available to user with price set to Handling Fee. If it does not suite your needs well you can return previous behavior by setting Min Weight to something a bit greater zero, e.g. 0.001, so that zero-weight orders will not match constraints and the shipping option will not be shown.
