Search and replace text, code blocks, URLs, media, images, jQuery/Ajax content or anything using advanced filters from a user-friendly interface

== Description ==
The plugin provides an optimized search and replace function, providing an effective solution for efficient database management. Additionally, it incorporates a dynamic real-time word / text replacing feature.

Ideal for site migrations and bulk updates, it offers powerful tools to find and replace text, images, and media across your database. With features like case-sensitive search, serialized data support, table-specific targeting, and a dry-run preview, it ensures precise changes with minimal effort. 

The real-time option employs a advanced word masking technique to search and replace text, url ( anything ), leaving no trace behind. The find and replace process takes place before the website is 
rendered in the browser and does not impact any other files or databases. With this ultimate solution, easily find and replace text, HTML code, media/image URLs, footer credits, 
or any other content within your website without touching the database with the help of an easy-to-use user interface.

On the other hand, the **permanent replace** ensuring that any replaced text, URL etc is eliminated from your database permanently.
The plugin is equipped with powerful features that allow you to visualize the results of search and replace content within your database as well as permanently erasing it. It has the ability to
search within complex, serialized data structures and replace them with your own words, making it a powerful tool for managing website content for beginners and experienced users alike. 
Additionally, it allows for the removal or un-setting of any element in serialized data by specifying its key.

Effortlessly **replace images** directly from the preview while ensuring seamless thumbnail regeneration for consistent visuals. Enjoy a blazing-fast **image replacement** process with enhanced efficiency and precision.
When replacing an image, you can easily update its alt text, caption, and description, which is beneficial for your SEO.

== How to replace in DB? ==
* **Start by generating a report**: Select the **Dry Run** option located at the bottom of the settings section.
* **Review the report**: A modal window will appear, showing the specific rows and data that will be affected by the replacement.
* **Proceed if satisfied**: If the preview looks accurate and matches what you intend to replace, simply close the report window, uncheck **Dry Run**, and click the **Find & Replace** button.
* **⚠️ Attention:** Please carefully review the dry run report before making any changes. Once replacements are applied to the database, they **cannot be undone**. The PRO version includes an undo feature, but it must be installed before performing the replacement.
* **✅ Important Tip:** Always run a dry report first to ensure your search term and replacement are correct. If anything looks off, adjust the keyword and repeat the process until the preview shows the desired results.
