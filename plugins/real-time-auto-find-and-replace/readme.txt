== How to replace in DB? ==
* **Start by generating a report**: Select the **Dry Run** option located at the bottom of the settings section.
* **Review the report**: A modal window will appear, showing the specific rows and data that will be affected by the replacement.
* **Proceed if satisfied**: If the preview looks accurate and matches what you intend to replace, simply close the report window, uncheck **Dry Run**, and click the **Find & Replace** button.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:** Please carefully review the dry run report before making any changes. Once replacements are applied to the database, they **cannot be undone**. The PRO version includes an undo feature, but it must be installed before performing the replacement.
* **‚úÖ Important Tip:** Always run a dry report first to ensure your search term and replacement are correct. If anything looks off, adjust the keyword and repeat the process until the preview shows the desired results.
