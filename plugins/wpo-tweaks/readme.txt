Advanced performance optimizations for WordPress. Improves speed, reduces server resources and optimizes PageSpeed.

== Description ==

WPO Tweaks is the most complete performance optimization plugin for WordPress. It combines the best WPO (Web Performance Optimization) practices in a single easy-to-use tool. No configuration needed: activate and enjoy a faster WordPress.

By default, WordPress loads several functions, services and scripts that are not mandatory and usually slow down your installation and consume hosting resources. For years I have been testing tweaks to save hosting resources and improve WordPress performance and loading times. After thousands of tests, this plugin includes my best speed and performance optimizations with a single click.

With this plugin you can safely disable those annoying services, unnecessary codes and scripts to save resources and hosting costs, and speed up WordPress to get better results in tools like Google PageSpeed, Pingdom Tools, GTMetrix, WebPageTest and others.

### HOW TO VERIFY OPTIMIZATIONS ARE WORKING

You can check each optimization individually to ensure WPO Tweaks is working correctly:

**Missing Image Dimensions:** Inspect images in your browser (F12 > Elements). Images should have `width="X"` and `height="Y"` attributes even if they weren't originally coded with dimensions.

**Critical CSS:** View page source (Ctrl+U) and look for `<style id="ayudawp-wpotweaks-critical-css">` in the head section containing basic CSS rules.

**Deferred CSS:** In source code, look for `<link>` tags with `rel="preload" as="style"` instead of `rel="stylesheet"`, followed by `<noscript>` fallbacks.

**Google Fonts Optimization:** Google Fonts URLs should include `&display=swap` parameter.

**Preconnect:** Look for `<link rel="preconnect">` tags in the head pointing to fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com, etc.

**DNS Prefetch:** Check for `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` tags pointing to external domains like gravatar.com, stats.wp.com.

**Lazy Loading:** Inspect images (F12) - they should have `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` attributes.

**Resource Preload:** Look for `<link rel="preload">` tags for your theme's CSS and critical fonts.

**Version Removal:** Source code should NOT contain `<meta name="generator" content="WordPress X.X">` or `?ver=` in script/style URLs.

**Dashicons Removal:** When logged out, source code should NOT include `dashicons.min.css`. When logged in, it should appear.

**Emojis Removal:** Source code should NOT contain `wp-emoji-release.min.js` or emoji-related styles.

**Header Cleanup:** Source code should NOT contain `<link rel="EditURI">`, `<link rel="wlwmanifest">`, or `<link rel="shortlink">`.

**JavaScript Defer:** Most `<script>` tags (except jQuery) should include the `defer` attribute.

**GZIP Compression:** Test at [giftofspeed.com/gzip-test](https://www.giftofspeed.com/gzip-test/) - should show "GZIP is enabled".

**Cache Headers:** Check your `.htaccess` file for a section marked "BEGIN WPO Tweaks by Fernando Tellado" with expiration rules.

**Heartbeat Control:** In WordPress Dashboard, open browser dev tools (F12) > Network tab. AJAX requests to `admin-ajax.php` with `action=heartbeat` should occur every 60 seconds instead of 15.

Use tools like Google PageSpeed, GTMetrix, Pingdom Tools, and WebPageTest to measure overall performance improvements. Always test twice to account for caching effects.

### COMPATIBILITY AND EXTENSIBILITY

The plugin includes multiple filters for developers:
* `ayudawp_wpotweaks_critical_css` - Customize critical CSS
* `ayudawp_wpotweaks_preconnect_hints` - Add custom preconnect
* `ayudawp_wpotweaks_dns_prefetch_domains` - Customize DNS prefetch domains
* `ayudawp_wpotweaks_critical_fonts` - Define critical fonts for preload
* `ayudawp_wpotweaks_keep_xmlrpc` - Keep XML-RPC if needed
* `ayudawp_wpotweaks_keep_feeds` - Control feeds removal

**Compatible with:**
* Jetpack (keeps XML-RPC automatically)
* All well-coded themes
* Cache plugins (W3 Total Cache, WP Rocket, etc.)
* WordPress Multisite
* Builders (Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg)

### INSTALLATION AND USE

**No options**. Just activate the plugin and test your site speed in your favorite tool (GTMetrix, Pingdom Tools, Google PageSpeed, etc.)

The plugin is completely automatic and applies optimizations safely without breaking functionality.

### MEASURING RESULTS

**Recommended tools:**
* [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
* [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

**Best measurement practices:**
* Run at least 2 tests (first one may not show cache)
* Always use the same tool for comparison
* Measure performance over time, not just once
* Remember that no tool can replace human perception

== Installation ==

1. Go to your WP Dashboard > Plugins and search for 'wpo tweaks' orâ€¦
2. Download the plugin from WP repository
3. Upload the 'wpo-tweaks' folder to '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does WPO mean? =

WPO stands for Web Performance Optimization. It measures a set of various improvements in optimization and improvement of performance and loading times of web pages.

= Where can I test my site performance? =

* Go to [Google PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and test your site
* Go to [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) and test your site
* Go to [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) and test your site

= What is the best way to test my site performance? =

Use one of the tools above and run at least two tests to measure your site performance. This is because cache systems don't load the first time your site is tested with these tools. Always test your site with the same tool and measure your site performance over time, not just once.

And always remember that no tool can replace human perception. If you see that your web loads faster than ever, no tool is going to tell you what you and your visitors feel in real life.

Don't go crazy with tools, they are machines and, for example, Google PageSpeed can show you a measure of 100/100 when your site is broken, and that's far from being an optimized web, right?

= How can I verify that the optimizations are working? =

Please check the "HOW TO VERIFY OPTIMIZATIONS ARE WORKING" section in the Description for detailed instructions on how to verify each optimization individually.

= Something went wrong after activation =

This plugin is compatible with all WordPress JavaScript functions (`wp_localize_script()`, js in header, in footer...) and works with all well-coded plugins and themes. If a plugin or theme is not enqueuing scripts correctly, your site may not work. If your hosting doesn't support some of the tweaks, usually due to security restrictions, something may fail. 

If something fails, please access your `/wp-content/plugins/wpo-tweaks/` directory via your favorite FTP client or hosting panel (cPanel, Plesk, etc.) and rename the plugin folder to deactivate it.

If you get a 500 Error (server error), then go to your hosting panel and edit the .htaccess file to remove the lines added by the plugin (they start with 'WPO Tweaks by Fernando Tellado') and save changes, or delete the file and create it again from Dashboard > Settings > Permalinks > Save changes.

= What's next? =

I will be including in next updates every new performance tweak I test for better results in order to speed up WordPress.

= Do you plan to include a settings panel? =

No. WPO Tweaks plugin is intended for users who want to get optimizations and speed safely with one click. If you are a developer and know what you are doing, then please check out [Machete plugin by my friend Nilo Velez](https://wordpress.org/plugins/machete/), a complete suite to decide how to solve common WordPress problems and annoyances. And yes, it has a huge settings page!

= Can I customize the optimizations? =

Yes, since v2.0+ the plugin includes multiple WordPress filters for developers that allow customizing plugin behavior according to specific site needs.
