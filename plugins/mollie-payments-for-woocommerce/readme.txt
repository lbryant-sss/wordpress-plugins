== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't install the plugin, the plugin is displayed incorrectly =

Please temporarily enable the [WordPress Debug Mode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress). Edit your `wp-config.php` and set the constants `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` to `true` and try
it again. When the plugin triggers an error, WordPress will log the error to the log file `/wp-content/debug.log`. Please check this file for errors. When done, don't forget to turn off
the WordPress debug mode by setting the two constants `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` back to `false`.

= I get a white screen when opening ... =

Most of the time a white screen means a PHP error. Because PHP won't show error messages on default for security reasons, the page is white. Please turn on the WordPress Debug Mode to turn on PHP error messages (see previous answer).

= The Mollie payment gateways aren't displayed in my checkout =

* Please go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments in your WordPress admin and scroll down to the Mollie settings section.
* Check which payment gateways are disabled.
* Go to the specific payment gateway settings page to find out why the payment gateway is disabled.

= The order status is not getting updated after successfully completing the payment =

* Please check the Mollie log file located in `/wp-content/uploads/wc-logs/` or `/wp-content/plugin/woocommerce/logs` for debug info. Please search for the correct order number and check if Mollie has called the shop Webhook to report the payment status.
* Do you have maintenance mode enabled? Please make sure to whitelist the 'wc-api' endpoint otherwise Mollie can't report the payment status to your website.
* Please check your Mollie dashboard to check if there are failed webhook reports. Mollie tried to report the payment status to your website but something went wrong.
* Contact info@mollie.com with your Mollie partner ID and the order number. We can investigate the specific payment and check whether Mollie successfully reported the payment state to your webshop.

= Payment gateways and mails aren't always translated =

This plugin uses [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/mollie-payments-for-woocommerce) for translations. WordPress will automatically add those translations to your website if they hit 100% completion at least once. If you are not seeing the Mollie plugin as translated on your website, the plugin is probably not translated (completely) into your language (you can view the status on the above URL).

You can either download and use the incomplete translations or help us get the translation to 100% by translating it.

To download translations manually:
1. Go to [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/mollie-payments-for-woocommerce/)
2. Click on the percentage in the "Stable" column for your language.
3. Scroll down to "Export".
4. Choose "All current" and "MO - Machine Object"
5. Upload this file to plugins/languages/mollie-payments-for-woocommerce/.
6. Repeat this for all your translations.

If you want to help translate the plugin, read the instructions in the [Translate strings instructions](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/#translating-strings).

= Can I add payment fees to payment methods? =

Yes, you can with a separate plugin. At the moment we have tested and can recommend [Payment Gateway Based Fees and Discounts for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/checkout-fees-for-woocommerce/). Other plugins might also work. For more specific information, also see [helpful snippets](https://github.com/mollie/WooCommerce/wiki/Helpful-snippets#add-payment-fee-to-payment-methods).

= Can I set up payment methods to show based on customers country? =

Yes, you can with a separate plugin. At the moment we have tested and can recommend [WooCommerce - Country Based Payments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-country-based-payments/). Other plugins might also work.

= Why do orders with payment method BankTransfer and Direct Debit get the status 'on-hold'? =

These payment methods take longer than a few hours to complete. The order status is set to 'on-hold' to prevent the WooCommerce setting 'Hold stock (minutes)' (https://docs.woothemes.com/document/configuring-woocommerce-settings/#inventory-options) will
cancel the order. The order stock is also reduced to reserve stock for these orders. The stock is restored if the payment fails or is cancelled. You can change the initial order status for these payment methods on their setting page.

= I have a different question about this plugin =

Please contact info@mollie.com with your Mollie partner ID, please describe your problem as detailed as possible. Include screenshots where appropriate.
Where possible, also include the Mollie log file. You can find the Mollie log files in `/wp-content/uploads/wc-logs/` or `/wp-content/plugin/woocommerce/logs`.

== Screenshots ==

1. The global Mollie settings are used by all the payment gateways. Please insert your Mollie API key to start.
2. Change the title and description for every payment gateway. Some gateways have special options.
3. The available payment gateways in the checkout.
4. The order received page will display the payment status and customer details if available.
5. The order received page for the gateway bank transfer will display payment instructions.
6. Some payment methods support refunds. The 'Refund' button will be available when the payment method supports refunds.
7. Within Mollie Dashboard, intuitive design meets clever engineering, allowing you to get more work done, in less time.
8. Also in Mollie Dashboard, get your administration done quick. You’ll have a detailed overview of your current balance.
9. Statistics with a double graph gives gives you extensive insights and data on how your business is performing.
10. Mollie Checkout turns a standard payment form into a professional experience that drives conversions.
