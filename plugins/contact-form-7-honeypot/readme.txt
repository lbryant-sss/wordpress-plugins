**Add extra functionalities to your Contact Form 7 forms with CF7Apps.**

Contact Form 7 is one of the most popular form plugins for WordPress, but **it lacks many advanced features** that modern websites need.

Whether you want to **block bots, store form entries, redirect users after submission, or build multi-step forms,** CF7Apps helps you do it all with zero coding and all in one easy-to-use plugin.

==What Is CF7Apps?==

CF7Apps is a collection of powerful, modular extensions explicitly designed for [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/). Built with performance and simplicity in mind, CF7Apps adds essential enhancements to your forms without writing a single line of code.

Each feature is designed as a standalone module, which gives you full control over which add-ons you activate. That means no unnecessary bloat‚Äîonly the features you need. From protecting your forms with advanced captchas to collecting entries in your database, CF7Apps is the toolkit every CF7 user should have.

**Disclaimer:** Currently, only the hCaptcha and Honeypot add-ons are available for Contact Form 7. The rest of the addons are under active development and will be released in future updates.

==What CF7Apps Can Do for You [Available Addons]==

Right out of the box, CF7Apps includes:

‚úÖ **hCaptcha App**
‚úÖ **Honeypot App**

And that‚Äôs just the beginning.

We‚Äôre building a growing library of focused apps to help you get more from Contact Form 7 without switching to bulky form builders or using 10 different plugins.

üåü **Add hCaptcha to Contact Form 7**
Protect your forms from spam bots using **hCaptcha,** a privacy-friendly alternative to Google reCAPTCHA. This extension integrates directly with CF7 and works instantly after setup. No coding is required, and no extra plugins are needed. Just set up your site keys and you're done.
üåü **Add a Honeypot Field to Prevent Spam**
Our **Honeypot Contact Form 7 extension** creates a hidden field inside your Contact Form 7 forms. Real users never see it, but bots do‚Äîand that's how the bots fall for the trap. It blocks automated spam before it even hits your inbox.

**NOTE:**
The best thing is that both features work independently. You can run them alone or together based on your site‚Äôs needs.

==Addons That Are Coming Soon to CF7Apps==

We're actively working on several new Contact Form 7 addons that bring premium-level functionality to your Contact Form 7 forms, which are given below:

 ‚û° **Cloudflare CAPTCHA App**
Add Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA to your Contact Form 7 forms. It‚Äôs more user-friendly than reCAPTCHA and works without Google tracking. Great for privacy-first websites and mobile experiences.
‚û° **Entries/Database App**
Save Contact Form 7 submissions directly inside your WordPress dashboard. No need for third-party integrations or email-only delivery tracking. View entries, export data, and keep a complete submission log.
‚û° **Redirection App**
Redirect users after form submission to any page or external URL. Send them to thank-you pages, checkout flows, upsells, or custom confirmations without writing a single line of code.
‚û° **Multistep Form App**
Split long Contact Form 7 forms into easy-to-complete steps using this upcoming addon. Guide your users through multi-page forms with step indicators and smart navigation.
‚û° **Range Slider App**
Add beautiful and functional range sliders to your Contact Form 7 forms. Perfect for numeric inputs like budgets, satisfaction scores, or quantity fields.

= Altering the Honeypot Output HTML [ADVANCED] =
While the basic settings should keep most people happy, we've added several filters for you to further customize the honeypot field. The three filters available are:

* `wpcf7_honeypot_accessibility_message` - Adjusts the default text for the (hidden) accessibility message (**can now be done on the settings page**).
* `wpcf7_honeypot_container_css` - Adjusts the CSS that is applied to the honeypot container to keep it hidden from view.
* `wpcf7_honeypot_html_output` - Adjusts the entire HTML output of the honeypot element.

For examples of the above, please see this [recipe Gist](https://gist.github.com/nocean/953b1362b63bd3ecf68c).
