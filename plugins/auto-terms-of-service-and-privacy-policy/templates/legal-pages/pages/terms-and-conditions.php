<p>By submitting such information, You grant us the right to provide the information to payment processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Your Order.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

<h4>Your Order Cancellation Rights</h4>

<p>Any Goods you purchase can only be returned in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and Our Returns Policy.</p>

<p>Our Returns Policy forms a part of these Terms and Conditions. Please read our Returns Policy to learn more about your right to cancel Your Order.</p>

<p>Your right to cancel an Order only applies to Goods that are returned in the same condition as You received them. You should also include all of the product's instructions, documents and wrappings. Goods that are damaged or not in the same condition as You received them or which are worn simply beyond opening the original packaging will not be refunded. You should therefore take reasonable care of the purchased Goods while they are in Your possession.</p>

<p>We will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which We receive the returned Goods. We will use the same means of payment as You used for the Order, and You will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.</p>

<p>You will not have any right to cancel an Order for the supply of any of the following Goods:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
    <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>

    <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h3>

<p>We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>

<h3>Prices Policy</h3>

<p>The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.</p>

<p>The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties, increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You will have the right to cancel Your Order.</p>

<h3>Payments</h3>

<p>All Goods purchased are subject to a one-time payment. Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa, MasterCard, Affinity Card, American Express cards or online payment methods (PayPal, for example).</p>

<p>At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.</p>

<h3>Subscription cancellations</h3>

<p>You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by contacting the Company.

<?php endif; ?>

<h3>Billing</h3>

<p>You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.</p>

<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<?php if (isset($in_app_purchases) && $in_app_purchases == 'Yes'): ?>

<p>The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.</p>

<?php if (isset($in_app_purchases) && $in_app_purchases == 'Yes'): ?>

<p>If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged by the Company until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless You canceled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.</p>

<p>At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

In no event will We charge You to replace or repair the In-app Purchase. In the unlikely event that we are unable to replace or repair the relevant In-app Purchase or are unable to do so within a reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to You, We will authorize the Application Store to refund You an amount up to the cost of the relevant In-app Purchase. Alternatively, if You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application Store directly.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that all billing and transaction processes are handled by the Application Store from where you downloaded the Application and are governed by that Application Store's own terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>

<p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
