All-in-One compliance solution from TermsFeed: Generator of Privacy Policy, T&Cs, Affiliate Disclaimers and Cookie Consent Notice Banner.

== Description ==

TermsFeed AutoTerms helps you with a wide range of legal requirements your WordPress website might be required to keep up with, such as GDPR, CCPA (CPRA) or Amazon Associates requirements to have a disclosure for affiliate links.

Previously, TermsFeed AutoTerms was called "WP AutoTerms" and "Auto Terms of Service and Privacy Policy".

= Generate Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions and other legal agreements =

TermsFeed AutoTerms helps you create the most important legal pages your WordPress website needs using a simple questionnaire, such as:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms & Conditions
- Cookies Policy
- Return Policy
- Disclaimer
- EULA

You can also create your own legal pages and manage them through the TermsFeed AutoTerms plugin.

= Compliance Kits =

"Compliance Kits" help you with certain legal compliance requirements:

* Cookie Consent. Manage vendors scripts you use (i.e. Google Analytics) and get user consent before scripts are loaded. Use this Kit and show a notice banner to visitors and get consent from users with "I Agree" and "I Decline" buttons.

* Cookie Notice. Inform users whenever cookies are used on your website. Use this Kit and display a simple announcement cookie notice banner.

* Links to Legal Pages. Your legal pages must be visible and accessible to all users. Use this Kit and automatically insert the links to your legal pages in the footer section of your website.

* Update Notices of Legal Pages. It's a best practice to inform users of your legal pages content updates. Use this Kit and show an announcement bar for a limited time to inform your users whenever you've updated your legal pages.

* Endorsements. You need to disclose if you have affiliate links on your website. Use this Kit and include a disclaimer at the start/end of any posts with affiliate links.
