== Formerly Instagram Feed Gallery ==

This plugin was formerly known as "Instagram Feed Gallery". WordPress forced us on August 8, 2019, to change the name of the plugin due to the use of the "Instagram" word in the name.

== Instagram Token setup ==

Social Feed Gallery offers a one-click setup, eliminating the need to create an app like other plugins require. Simply add your credentials, select an Instagram @id or #tags, click on the "Add New Account" button, and your Instagram access token will be automatically generated and saved.

== Social Feed Gallery Premium ==

Upgrade to Social Feed Gallery Premium to enjoy additional features, including:

* Multiple Instagram user accounts
* Masonry and highlight gallery layouts
* Boxed mode with colors and borders
* Display user profile avatar, username, and custom description
* Load more button
* And much more!

Check out the [Documentation](https://quadlayers.com/documentation/instagram-feed-gallery/) for more information on configuration possibilities.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display pictures from Instagram Tag? =

Yes, you can.

= Can I display pictures in Instagram Widget? =

Yes, you can.

= Why are my pictures not showing on the page? =

You have to update your Instagram access token to display user media.

=How to add Instagram Gallery to a widget? =

Go to your admin dashboard, add a new Instagram gallery, then go to widgets, add Instagram Gallery Widget, and select the Gallery item from the dropdown list.

= Why are there two popups on image click? =

There may be other plugins (like fancybox, elementor) that also use image links to open popups. Try disabling the popup images option in the setting panel of this plugin, which will allow other plugins to work.
