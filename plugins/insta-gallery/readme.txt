== Formerly Instagram Feed Gallery ==

This plugin was formerly known as "Instagram Feed Gallery". WordPress forced us on August 8, 2019, to change the name of the plugin due to the use of the "Instagram" word in the name.

== Instagram Token setup ==

Social Feed Gallery offers a one-click setup, eliminating the need to create an app like other plugins require. Simply add your credentials, select an Instagram @id or #tags, click on the "Add New Account" button, and your Instagram access token will be automatically generated and saved.

== Social Feed Gallery Premium ==

Upgrade to Social Feed Gallery Premium to enjoy additional features, including:

* Multiple Instagram user accounts
* Masonry and highlight gallery layouts
* Boxed mode with colors and borders
* Display user profile avatar, username, and custom description
* Load more button
* And much more!

Check out the [Documentation](https://quadlayers.com/documentation/instagram-feed-gallery/) for more information on configuration possibilities.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin include an Elementor widget/block? =

Yes. As of version 4.7.8 the plugin ships with a native Elementor block so you can drag & drop feeds without shortcodes, giving you full visual control inside the Elementor editor.

= Does the plugin include a Gutenberg block? =

Yes. The plugin includes a native Gutenberg block that allows you to insert and style your Instagram feeds visually inside the Block Editor without using shortcodes.

= What's the difference between Personal and Professional Instagram accounts? =

Personal accounts can display basic user media and profile information. Professional accounts unlock premium features like Instagram Stories, hashtag feeds, tagged media feeds, and comments display.

= Can I display Instagram hashtag feeds? =

Yes, but only with Professional Instagram accounts. You can track up to 30 unique hashtags within a 7-day period due to Instagram API limitations.

= Can I display Instagram Stories? =

Yes, Instagram Stories are supported as a premium feature for Professional Instagram accounts only. Stories are cached for 1 hour and automatically updated.

= Can I show posts where my account is tagged? =

Yes, tagged media feeds are available as a premium feature for Professional Instagram accounts. This displays photos and videos where your Instagram account has been tagged by others.

= Why are my pictures not showing on the page? =

This usually happens when your Instagram access token has expired or is invalid. Go to Social Feed Gallery > Accounts in your admin dashboard and regenerate your access token by clicking "Add new account" button.

= How many images can I display in my feed? =

You can set any number for the image limit. The default is 12 images, but you can increase this in your feed settings. Keep in mind that more images may affect page loading speed.

= Can I hide Instagram Reels from my feed? =

Yes, there's an option in the feed settings to hide Instagram Reels if you only want to display photos and regular videos.

= Why are there two popups when I click on images? =

This happens when you have other plugins (like Fancybox, Elementor lightbox, or gallery plugins) that also handle image clicks. You can disable the popup option in Social Feed Gallery settings to let other plugins handle the lightbox.

= What layouts are available? =

Free version includes Gallery and Carousel layouts. Premium version adds Masonry (Pinterest-style) and Highlight layouts. All layouts are fully responsive and customizable.

= Can I customize the colors and styling? =

Yes, you can customize icon colors for likes/comments, button colors, spacing, borders, and more. Premium version includes additional styling options like boxed mode and advanced responsive controls.

= How often does the plugin update my Instagram content? =

The plugin uses smart caching to optimize performance: user media is cached for 6 hours, while Instagram Stories are cached for 1 hour. You can manually clear the cache anytime from the feed settings.

= Does the plugin work with cache plugins? =

Yes, the plugin is compatible with popular caching plugins like WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, and WP Super Cache. The Instagram content has its own caching system independent of page caching.

= Can I use multiple Instagram accounts? =

Multiple Instagram accounts are supported in the premium version. The free version supports one Instagram account. But you can create multiple feeds with one account ;).

= What are the Instagram API limitations I should know about? =

Instagram limits hashtag queries to 30 unique hashtags per 7 days for Professional accounts. The plugin includes a hashtag tracking system to help you stay within these limits. Personal accounts have more restrictions and can only access basic user media.
