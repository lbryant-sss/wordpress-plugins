- Target PHP 7.4 an up.
- Use WordPress coding standards. This include:
  - no short ternary operators (use standard conditionals).
- Do not use colons for if/else statements or foreach statements (do not use format `if (true): ... endif;`, do instead use format `if (true) {...}`)
- Use short array syntax.
- Don't write this way:
  `<?php foreach ( $top_users as $user ) { ?>`
  instead write this way by putting new lines before foreach and after `{`.
  ```php
  <?php
  foreach ( $top_users as $user ) {
    ?>
  ```
