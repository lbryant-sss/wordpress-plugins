*** Weglot Translate Changelog ***

2025-10-28 - version 5.2
* Improvement: Introduces weglot/v1/cache/purge REST route with HMAC auth and idempotency to purge cache, replacing the old Clean_Options init-based cleaner.
* Improvement: Renames the REST request helper from is_rest to wg_is_rest and updates its usage in the redirect logic.
* Improvement: Introduce a filterable admin-context mechanism to skip Weglot initialization and wire it into weglot_is_compatible().
* Improvement: Explicitly declares the definitions property on Schema_Option_V3 to replace deprecated dynamic property usage.
* Fix: Prevents translation conflicts when using the Breakdance editor by excluding AJAX requests during editing sessions.
