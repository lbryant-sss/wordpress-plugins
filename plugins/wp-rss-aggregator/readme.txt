**Content Curation: [Personal Finance Blogs](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-personal-finance-blogs-content-curation/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_description)**
"It has been approximately four and a half months since the launch. We‚Äôve seen some **strong traffic growth** month over month. We‚Äôre up to over 10,000 page views a month, which is great for a new blog but also just any blog in general. In terms of the traffic, **we‚Äôre sending about 150 clicks to various posts and blogs** on a daily basis." - Erik Tozier ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Industry News Aggregator: [World of WordPress](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-worldofwp-multilingual-news-aggregator/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_description)**
"I was searching for a good plugin to aggregate all the feeds. WP RSS Aggregator has the functionality I was looking for. I‚Äôve tried other plugins, but **this was the one I knew could do everything**. I get 150 visitors a day, so that‚Äôs probably 4,500 visitors per month, and I think maybe **99% of visitors land on one of the articles aggregated by the plugin**." - Ronald Heijnes ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Content Syndication: [The Broker List](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-content-syndication-thebrokerlist/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_description)**

I would definitely work with Mark and his team. **They will give you 110%** and solve any issues you may have." - Linda Day Harrison ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Local News Aggregator: [Bristol Today](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/bristol-today-case-study/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_description)**
"After identifying the news sources I wanted to link out to, I searched for the best possible way to create a reliable feed (and without ruffling any feathers!). Thankfully, RSS is still going strong and each of the sites had active feeds. After a bit of research, WP RSS Aggregator stood out as the leading WordPress plugin in the space and I was impressed with their product pages. - Ross Merritt ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What websites can I import content from? =

You can import content from any website that offers a valid RSS or XML feed. Just enter the website URL into WP RSS Aggregator, and it will automatically detect and list the available feeds for you. Most websites provide RSS feeds - [here's how to find them](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/help/finding-an-rss-feed/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq).

- - -

= How do I display the imported feed items? =

Create a display with the layout of your choice to showcase imported items anywhere across your site. To show the items, you can use either one (or a combination) of the options below.

* Option 1: Use our [block](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/help/block/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) in the Gutenberg/block editor (WP 5.0 and later).
* Option 2: Use our [shortcode](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/help/shortcode/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) in your posts and pages.

- - -

= Is there a limit on the number of feed sources I can set up? =

No, there is no limit for the number of feed sources to import items from. Having many (50+) feed sources should not present any problems in itself. However, pulling in posts from many sites is bound to put your server under some stress, so you might want to consider using a hosting solution that goes beyond your typical shared host and staggering the feed imports.

Check out our dedicated page on [WordPress hosting](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/recommended-web-hosts/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) recommendations.

- - -

= Can I import the full text from any source site? =

In the majority of cases, this is possible using our Feed to Post and Full Text features, both of which are part of our most popular bundle, the [Pro Plan](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/pro-plan/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq). When importing the full text from a source, please make sure to check and abide by the source site's terms and conditions on the sharing of their content.

- - -

= Can I add Twitter (now known as X) RSS feeds to my WordPress site? =

Creating Twitter RSS feeds for your WordPress site involves a few simple steps using third-party services since Twitter no longer offers native RSS feed support. Here‚Äôs a quick overview:

1. Select a Third-Party Service:¬†Use an RSS feed generator such as RSS.app or Nitter to create your Twitter RSS feed. These platforms allow you to convert Twitter content into RSS feeds.

2. Generate Your Twitter RSS Feed:¬†Follow the specific instructions on your chosen platform to generate the RSS feed URL for the Twitter content you wish to display.

3. Integrate with WP RSS Aggregator:¬†Once you have your RSS feed URL, use WP RSS Aggregator on your WordPress site to add and configure your new feed source.

For detailed instructions, including step-by-step guidance, please visit [our¬†full article on creating Twitter RSS feeds](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/twitter-rss/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq).

- - -

= How can I display the latest posts from a Facebook page on my WordPress site? =

To showcase the latest posts from a Facebook page on your WordPress site, you can create an RSS feed for that Facebook page using a third-party service like FetchRSS. Once you have the RSS feed URL, you can easily integrate this feed into your site using WP RSS Aggregator. For a detailed guide on generating the RSS feed and integrating it with WP RSS Aggregator, including step-by-step instructions, visit [our full article on how to create a Facebook RSS feed](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/facebook-rss-feed/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq).

- - -

= Does WP RSS Aggregator work using JSON as the source? =

No, our plugin does not currently import from JSON, it only imports from RSS and Atom structured XML.

- - -

= Why do I get "No feed items found" when I insert the shortcode on a page or post? =

1. Try adding a few more feed sources and make sure they are valid by using the RSS Feed Validator.

2. Make sure that feed items have been imported by visiting the Feed Items page.

3. Try out the solutions listed in our [Feed Items Not Importing](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/help/items-not-importing/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) help center section.

4. It's important to make sure your WordPress cron system is working well. If not, the feeds cannot be imported. If in doubt, you can install the WP Crontrol plugin to check for bad cron or check out these [helpful tips](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/help/solutions-to-cron-issues/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq).

You will not only be able to store items as posts, but as any post type. You can also set the author, set tags and categories, import images into the gallery or set featured images, and much more. These can then be displayed in your theme's blog page, via a page builder, etc. Add [Full Text RSS Feeds](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/features/full-text-rss-feeds/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) into the mix for the most powerful combination of features.

Yes, along with the [Feed to Post](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/features/feed-to-post/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) feature we have another feature called [Full Text RSS Feeds](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/features/full-text-rss-feeds/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq) that can get the full content of most feeds that only supply a short excerpt. Both of these features are available in the [Pro Plan](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/pro-plan/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_faq).
