Breadcrumb NavXT, the successor to the popular WordPress plugin Breadcrumb Navigation XT, was written from the ground up to be better than its ancestor. This plugin generates locational breadcrumb trails for your WordPress powered blog or website.

The Administrative interface makes setting options easy, while a direct class access is available for theme developers and more adventurous users.
