This plugin is a 'One Click' WordPress database cleaner & optimizer, with precise revision cleanup and flexible scheduling.

* Deletes trashed posts, pages and comments (optional)
* Deletes spammed comments (optional)
* Deletes unused tags (optional)
* Deletes 'expired or all transients' (optional)
* Deletes 'pingbacks' and 'trackbacks' (optional)
* Clears the 'OEMBED cache' (optional)
* Deletes 'orphan postmeta items'

* Creates a log of the optimizations (optional)
* Optimization can be scheduled to automatically run once hourly, twice daily, once daily or once weekly at a specific time (optional)
* 'Optimize DB (1 click)' link in the admin bar (optional)
* 'Optimize Database' Icon in the admin menu (optional)
* MULTISITE compatible: optimizes all sites in the network with one click

= Settings =
You can find the settings page in the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Optimize Database -or- via the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Optimize Database icon (depends on settings)

= Excluding specific posts/pages from deleting revisions =
If you want to keep revisions for a specific post/page (no matter what the other settings are), create a custom field named 'keep_revisions' for that post/page and give it the value 'Y'<br>

= Starting the Analysis / Optimization =
You can start the Optimization in the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Optimize Database.<br>
Note: if you use the Scheduler the Optimization will run automatically!<br>
Note: you also can click the 'Optimize DB (1 click)' link in the admin bar (if enabled)<br>
You can click one of the following buttons:<br>
'Analyze (summary): analyzes the database and gives the count of what will be cleaned<br>
'Analyze (detail): analyzes the database and gives a detailed report of what will be deleted<br>
'Optimize (summary): actually deletes the items and gives the count of what has been deleted<br>
'Optimize (detail): actually deletes the items and gives a detailed report of what has been deleted<br>

= Multisite Support =
* Install the plugin as Network Administrator (Network Admin &raquo; Plugins)
* 'Network Activate' the plugin
* You only can configure and run the plugin on the main network site, but it will optimize ALL the sub-sites too!

= Running the plug in from a Unix crontab =
In case you cannot use WPCron, but you can edit the Unix crontab:<br><br>
Create a .php file, in the root directory of your site, with:<br>
&lt;?php<br>
define('RUN_OPTIMIZE_DATABASE', true);<br>
require_once('wp-load.php');<br>
?&gt;<br><br>
Then, start the .php file from your crontab!<br>

* Click the 'Optimize DB (1 click)' link in the Admin Bar (if enabled)

= How do I run the Analyzer? =
* Go to: Dashboard &raquo; Tools &raquo; Optimize Database and click the 'Analyze Database' button

= Why do I see 'InnoDB table: skipped...'? =
* That's because optimizing InnoDB tables is not really efficient, so change the table type to MyISAM to have them being optimized.
* Update: if you want to optimize your InnoDB tables too, just check the 'Optimize InnoDB tables too' option on the settings page
* IMPORTANT: optimizing InnoDB tables, might increase the size of the database! However, it will speed up the performance of the database

= After I ran the plugin, I got "Total savings since the first run: -64 KB" =
* Sometimes that happens when you optimize InnoDB tables (instead of MyISAM tables).
Optimizing InnoDB tables works differently than MyISAM.
InnoDB focuses on speed optimization and sometimes it means the database can grow a little.

= I scheduled the optimization for 8pm but it runs at 6pm (my local time) =
* The scheduler uses the local time of the web server which can differ from your own local time

= The plugin is visible in Main Site Tools but not in my subsites =
* Multisite Support
– Install the plugin as Network Administrator (Network Admin » Plugins)
– ‘Network Activate’ the plugin
– You only can configure and run the plugin on the main network site, but it will optimize ALL the sub-sites too!
