= Compatibility with WooCommerce plugins =
Advanced AJAX Product Filters has been tested and compatibility is certain with the following WooCommerce plugins that you can add to your site:

&#128312; [**Advanced Product Labels for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-product-labels-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Load More Products for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/load-more-products-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Brands for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/brands-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Grid/List View for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gridlist-view-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Product Preview for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-preview-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Products Compare for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/products-compare-for-woocommerce/)
&#128312; [**Wishlist and Waitlist for WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wish-wait-list-for-woocommerce/)

= Shortcode: =
* In editor `[br_filters attribute=price type=slider title="Price Filter"]`
* In PHP `do_shortcode('[br_filters attribute=price type=slider title="Price Filter"]');`

= Shortcode Options: =
* `attribute`(required) - product attribute, e.g. price or length. Don't forget that WooCommerce adds the pa_ suffix for created attributes.
 So if you create a new attribute `jump`, its name is `pa_jump`
* `type`(required) - checkbox, radio, slider or select
* `operator` - OR or AND
* `title` - whatever you want to see as a title. Can be empty
* `product_cat` - parent category id
* `cat_propagation` - should we propagate this filter to child categories? Set 1 to turn this on
* `height` - max filter box height. When height is met, the scroll will be added
* `scroll_theme` - used if height is set and actual height of the box is more


= Advanced Settings (Widget area): =
* Product Category - this is a good place to pin your filter to a product's category.
 For example, you sell phones and cases for them. If the user chooses the Category "Phones", the filter "Have Wi-Fi" will appear, but if the user chooses "Cases", it will not be there as the Admin sets that the "Have Wi-Fi" filter will be visible only on the "Phones" category.
* Filter Box Height - if your filter has too many options, it is nice to limit the height of the filter so that it does not prolong the page too much. A scroll will appear.
* Scroll theme - if "Filter Box Height" is set and the box length is more than "Filter Box Height," the scroll will appear, and how it looks depends on the theme you choose.


= Advanced Settings (Plugin Settings): =
* Plugin settings can be found in admin area, WooCommerce -> Product Filters
* "No Products" message - Text that will be shown if no products are found
* "No Products" class - Add class and use it to style "No Products" box
* Products selector - Selector for a tag that is holding products
* Sorting control - Take control over WooCommerce's sorting selection
* SEO-friendly URLs - URL will be changed when the filter is selected/changed
* Turn all filters off - If you want to hide filters without losing the current configuration, just turn them off



== Installation ==

= Step 1: =
* First, you need to add attributes to the products( the WooCommerce plugin should be installed and activated already )
* Go to Admin area -> Products -> Attributes and add attributes your products will have
* Click the attribute's name where the type is selected and add values to it. Predefine product options
* Go to your products and add attributes to each of them

= Step 2: =
* Install and activate the plugin
* First of all, open Admin area -> WooCommerce -> Product Filter and check what global options you can manage
* After that, open Admin area -> Appearance -> Widgets
* In Available Widgets ( left side of the screen ) find AJAX Product Filters
* Add it to the Sidebar you choose
* Enter title, choose an attribute that will be used for filtering products, choose filter type, choose operator( whether a product should have all selected values (AND) or one of them (OR) ),
* Click save and go to your shop to check how it works.
* That's it =)
