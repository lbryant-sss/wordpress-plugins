Here are some of the important features of the Live sales notification for WooCommerce:

= Core features =
* No need to connect your WooCommerce store with a backend platform like other plugins require
* Show **original orders** placed as a live sales feed to other visitors
* There is **no restriction** on the number of products that will be shown, as other plugins have in their Free version
* If you don't have a large number of orders then you can show **virtual orders** as well
* Virtual orders can be generated from visitors' **recent product views**; in this case their recently viewed product will be shown in the notification. This will encourage the visitor to buy it.
* Create virtual orders from your **selected products**
* You can create a **custom message** that will be shown in the notification, e.g.: Mr. Dave from New York just purchased XYZ
* You can customize the message using shortcodes like **{date}, {time}, {first_name}, {city}, {state}, {country}, {product}, {price}**
* When the order is original, this shortcode information comes from the original order; when the order is virtual, this information is auto-generated for you
* Set how old orders should be extracted for the notification; you can set this in **weeks, months, and hours**.
* **Select products from categories** to create virtual orders
* Fast and lightweight.
* Boosts sales and conversion rate.

= Layout features =
You can control the complete look and feel of the notification from the plugin settings

* **Disable notification on mobile**; mobile breakpoint starts from 968px
* Notification width, image width in the notification
* **Link image** to product or not
* Open link in a **new tab** or in the same tab
* **Background color** of the notification
* **Position** of the notification
* **Text color, font size, and weight** of the notification text
* You can even **customize color, font size, and weight** for each of the texts coming from shortcodes, so you can have different font size for {date}, and a different font size for {product}
* You can **disable the closing notification option** for the user, so the user can't close the notification
