Without implementing Holistic SEO and being guided through the process by an AI, those results would have been impossible to achieve with plugins that don't offer real SEO tools, like the ones you expect from Ahrefs and SEMrush.

**SEO Doesn’t Have to Be Boring. Or Blind. Or Broken.

Squirrly SEO is not “just another SEO plugin.” It’s a full-blown AI SEO assistant that helps you win rankings — even in the age of AI, Google updates, and brutal competition.

**Who It’s For:
Entrepreneurs, bloggers, eCommerce stores, and marketers who want to rank without selling their soul to algorithms.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Squirrly together with Rank Math? Could I replace Rank Math altogether with Squirrly? =
Yes, you can use Squirrly SEO alongside Rank Math if you want to, as Squirrly enables you to deactivate certain settings or modules so that Squirrly SEO and Rank Math can work in compatibility mode.

If Squirrly stops handling source code changes, then it works with Rank Math, SEOpress, All In One SEO SEO, Yoast, and others. Regarding whether you could replace Rank Math altogether with Squirrly SEO, this graphic linked below shows you a side-by-side comparison of Squirrly SEO vs. Rank Math.

There are around 650 features in Squirrly SEO, most of which can’t be found in Rank Math, given that Rank Math does not offer a duality between plugin and cloud services.

https://www.squirrly.co/wordpress/plugins/second-seo-features-page/

You will see there all that it offers. It is incredibly valuable for SEO and does everything required for SEO, unlike the pillar feature in Rank Math. It offers more than even Moz or Ahrefs does in terms of content analysis.

Check out these graphics

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/

to see how Squirrly compares to other SEO plugins such as Yoast, Rank Math, SEOPress, SEO Framework, and All in One SEO.

= How does Squirrly compare with plugins like SEO Framework, SEO Press, Rank Math, All in one SEO, or Yoast in terms of site speed and pagespeed? =
Most of the processing, data storage, and other things that only Squirrly SEO can do, are actually things that happen on our Cloud Servers. The duality between plugin and Cloud Services (APIs, crawlers, big data, A.I., MarketIntelligence services) allows us to load the plugin’s code very fast.

The duality between SEO plugin and Cloud Services gives us an advantage over other WordPress SEO plugins like SEO Framework, SEO Press, Rank Math, All in One SEO, Rank Math, and Yoast.

= How is Squirrly Addressing the Core Web Vitals SEO Scoring Method? =
Squirrly is addressing them with Focus Pages.

Page experience has been one of the main reasons we’ve created Focus Pages and it goes a little beyond just pagespeed and coding propriety.

Time on page, bounce rates, number of pages visited are also very important and we’re getting clear signals that their importance is shifting.

We already address pagespeed and https and give resources to our users, so they are prepared for the update.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/focus-pages-page-audits/

= What is the advantage of using Squirrly’s keyword research tool instead of using an external tool for this? =
Squirrly’s built-in keyword research tool allows you to perform keyword research without leaving WordPress.

Furthermore, Squirrly also provides access to features like Briefcase, which means you can not only find keywords but also organize them into tighter groups for a better strategy. Furthermore, our keyword research data is fresh, since we don’t use caching (cached databases). 

Maximum caching time is about 48 hours, not a whole year or two years like you find in other tools.

As we use Google API for search volume, Social Media for discussions, the data should be fresh every time and this is why it is different from others – and also why the data we show is different from what you may find in other keyword research tools who use caching for their data. (caching time can be extremely high for some of those tools).

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/keyword-research-and-seo-strategy/

= Can you guarantee SEO results? =
If you follow what we outline here, then yes. We will guarantee (please read the following resource):

https://plugin.squirrly.co/squirrly-seo-pro-results-guarantee/

= Why is Squirrly Keyword Research better than Google Keyword Planner for SEO strategies? =

Because our tool focuses on the information your need to better rank on Google not to get your Ads in front of more people. Google Keyword Planner is a great research tool if you are creating Adwords campaigns. For SEO our keyword generator tool is better.

= I can't log into the Wordpress with my user. Get the message 'An error occured.' What can I do? =
I see that your host server is not letting you access our remote API.
Please tell your webmaster to add the IPs 176.9.121.162 and 176.9.112.210 in the white-list for remote access and it should work.
