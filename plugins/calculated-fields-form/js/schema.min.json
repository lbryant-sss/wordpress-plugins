This expression is automatically re-evaluated whenever a relevant event occurs, such as 'onchange' or 'keyup' on a referenced field, or when a calculation button is pressed. The expression can be a simple arithmetic operation (e.g., 'fieldname1 + fieldname2') or a more complex function that applies JavaScript logic to determine the output. For example, consider the following self-invoking function: (function() { if (!(fieldname1 === 0 && fieldname2 === 0)) { return Math.pow(fieldname1, fieldname2); } else { return ''; } })(); \n\nImportant Notes:\n- The expression must reference only existing field names (e.g., 'fieldname1') and cannot reference its own field name to prevent recursive calculations.\n- Field names may include suffixes for special behavior:\n  - '|r': Accesses the raw field value without preprocessing (e.g., 'fieldname1|r').\n  - '|n': Retrieves the field name instead of its current value (e.g., 'fieldname1|n').\n- These suffix-based field references are recognized by the system, even if they do not conform to typical constant naming conventions.\n- When working with date fields, always use the '|r' suffix to obtain the field's value in date format: const d = new Date(fieldname1|r);","type":"string","default":"","examples":["fieldname1 + fieldname2","(function(){ if (!(fieldname1 === 0 && fieldname2 === 0)) { return Math.pow(fieldname1, fieldname2); } else { return ''; } })()"]},"min":{"description":"Specifies the minimum number accepted for the field value.
