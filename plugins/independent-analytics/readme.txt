**The ONLY analytics tool with full WordPress integration**

Independent Analytics is different from Google Analytics and other analytics apps.

Other analytics tools watch your site from the outside like a visitor, but as a plugin, Independent Analytics runs on the inside. This means it has access to much more data to display in your reports. For instance, tools like Google Analytics will only list your URLs, but Independent Analytics lists each page by title and includes other properties, like the author, post type, and more.

**Loved by the WP community** ❤️

**No more copying & pasting tracking codes**

Just install the plugin, and tracking starts right away. You don't need to mess with any tracking codes, edit your site's head element, or create an account elsewhere.

**GDPR Compliant**

Independent Analytics is privacy-friendly by design.

* Does not use cookies
* Does not store personally identifiable information (PII)
* Data is created and stored entirely on your server

Since Independent Analytics uses cookie-less tracking and doesn't store PII, you don't need to add a cookie popup to collect tracking consent.

**Data portability**

As an analytics WordPress plugin, your data is collected and stored entirely on your server. This means you can:

* Backup your analytics every time you backup your site
* Transfer your analytics to any domain
* Export your data and save it locally or on the cloud

**Who's it for?**

Independent Analytics is easy enough for a total beginner to use while still offering tools for deep data analysis for any WordPress website.

* **Bloggers:** use Independent Analytics as a simple blog stats plugin. Find out how many views your posts get and how much traffic you get from search engines and social media.
* **eCommerce stores:** track views and visitors for your WooCommerce products and find out which countries visit your site the most.
* **News sites:** get same-day statistics for all your posts and filter by author to find your most successful writers.
* **Startups:** start tracking your visits right away and find out which early marketing tactics are driving results.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this use Google Analytics? =
No, Independent Analytics is an alternative to Google Analytics.

= Can I use Independent Analytics and Google Analytics at the same time? =
Yes, you can run them both simultaneously without any issues or errors.

= Will it slow down my site? =
No, the tracking script is only 2kb and is inlined to the page, so there will be virtually zero difference in your site's performance after installing Independent Analytics.

= Does tracking start right away? =
Yes, the moment you install Independent Analytics it will start tracking views. If you don't see any views right away, clear your site's cache and then visit your site in a private browser tab to record your first view.

= What metrics does it track? =
It tracks views, visitors, sessions, session duration, bounce rate, and average session duration. 

= Do I need to use a cookie popup with it? =
No, Independent Analytics does not use cookies.

= Is there a tracking code? =
Yes, but you don't have to add it yourself. It gets included on all of your site's pages automatically once Independent Analytics is activated.

= Does it work if I use Matomo? =
Yes, Independent Analytics will run smoothly and won't create any errors even if you're already using Matomo or any other analytics plugin.

= Are bot visits counted? =
We use best practice techniques to filter out bot visits as efficiently as possible. If you compare to traffic from Google Analytics, you'll find that your views and visitors are very similar. If you need to further eliminate bots from getting counted, we recommend adding a Firewall with Cloudflare.
