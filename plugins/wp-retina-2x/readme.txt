== Description ==

Take complete control of your images with Perfect Images! This powerful plugin helps you optimize and manage your images with ease. Seamlessly replace or regenerate existing images in bulk, set custom sizes, improve performance, and create retina-ready versions for high-quality displays. Whether you're working with core JPEGs, WebPs, or AVIFs, Perfect Images has you covered. Upscaling is also supported to generate thumbnails that weren't possible before. With additional features like CDN support and the ability to disable image thresholding, you can fine-tune your image management to suit your needs. Perfect Images is fast, efficient, and fully compatible with other plugins without creating new database tables.

**Key Features:**

* **Manage Image Sizes**: Customize, disable, and track image sizes effortlessly.

Originally designed to handle retina images, Perfect Images has evolved into an indispensable tool for any WordPress site.

== Features in Detail ==

=== Manage Image Sizes ===

Simplify your image management by disabling unnecessary sizes and tracking the sizes created for each media entry. For instance, you can disable WordPress-generated sizes like `medium_large`, `1536x1536`, and `2048x2048` to save space and resources.

=== Replace Image & Media ===

Replace images quickly and effortlessly. Whether through the dedicated plugin dashboard or directly from the Media Library and Edit Attachment pages, you can streamline your workflow and avoid manual replacements.

=== Regenerate Thumbnails ===

Update your thumbnails in bulk with ease. A built-in progress bar keeps you informed, while the plugin handles all the details, including regenerating retina images and updating media metadata. Upscaling ensures that thumbnails can even be created for sizes that were previously unsupported.

=== Retina Images / High DPI ===

Ensure your site looks stunning on all devices. Perfect Images generates and serves retina-ready images automatically. Additionally, you can manually create retina images and even generate retina versions for full-size images. Visit our official website for more details and tutorials.

=== Disable Image Threshold ===

Disable WordPress’ automatic scaling of large images, preventing files with "-scaled" in their filenames from being created.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install it directly through the WordPress plugin repository.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the plugin settings to configure your preferences.
