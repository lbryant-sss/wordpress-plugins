#### Some (but not all) features

- Connect with your Mailchimp account in seconds.

- Sign-up forms which are good looking, user-friendly and mobile optimized. You have complete control over the form fields and can build your forms using native HTML.

- [Mailchimp for WordPress Premium](https://www.mc4wp.com/): Send your WooCommerce orders to Mailchimp so you can see exactly what each subscriber purchased and how much revenue your email campaigns are generating.

- A multitude of available add-on plugins and integrations:
  - [Mailchimp for WordPress Premium](https://www.mc4wp.com/)
  - [Mailchimp Top Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-top-bar/)
  - [Boxzilla Pop-ups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/boxzilla/)

- Well documented through our [knowledge base](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/).

- Developer friendly. For some inspiration, check out our [repository of example code snippets](https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-for-wordpress/tree/main/sample-code-snippets).

- Ready for PHP 8.5, but backwards-compatible all the way down to PHP 7.4.

#### What is Mailchimp?

Mailchimp is a newsletter service that allows you to send out email campaigns to a list of email subscribers. It is free for lists with up to 500 email subscribers, which is why it is the newsletter-service of choice for thousands of small businesses across the globe.

If you are not yet using Mailchimp, [creating an account is 100% free and only takes you about 30 seconds](http://eepurl.com/igOGeX).

== Installation ==

#### Installing the plugin
1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Plugins > New Plugin*, search for **Mailchimp for WordPress** and click "*Install now*"
1. Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of `mailchimp-for-wp.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin
1. Set [your API key](https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api) in the plugin settings.

#### Configuring Sign-Up Form(s)
1. Go to *Mailchimp for WP > Forms*
2. Select at least one list to subscribe people to.
3. *(Optional)* Add more fields to your form.
4. Embed a sign-up form in pages or posts using the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode or Gutenberg block.
5. Show a sign-up form in your widget areas using the "Mailchimp Sign-Up Form" widget.
6. Show a sign-up form from your theme files by using the `mc4wp_show_form()` PHP function.

#### Need help?
Please take a look at the [MC4WP knowledge base](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=installation-instructions-link) first.

If you can't find an answer there, please look through the [plugin support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mailchimp-for-wp) or start your own topic.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Where can I find my Mailchimp API key?
You can [find your API key here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys#Find-or-Generate-Your-API-Key)

#### How to display a form in posts or pages?
Use the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode or the Gutenberg block.

#### How to display a form in widget areas like the sidebar or footer?
Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and use the **Mailchimp for WP Form** widget that comes with the plugin.

#### How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 form?
Use the following shortcode in your CF7 form to display a newsletter sign-up checkbox.

`
[mc4wp_checkbox "Subscribe to our newsletter?"]
`

Our knowledge base has more information on [connecting Contact Form 7 and Mailchimp](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/connecting-contact-form-7-and-mailchimp/).

#### The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)?
If the form shows a success message, there is no doubt that the sign-up request succeeded. Mailchimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though. Please check again in a few minutes (sometimes hours) and don't forget to check your junk folder too.

When you have double opt-in disabled, new subscribers will be seen as *imports* by Mailchimp. They will not show up in your daily digest emails or statistics. [We always recommend leaving double opt-in enabled](http://blog.mailchimp.com/double-opt-in-vs-single-opt-in-stats/).

#### How can I style the sign-up form?
You can use custom CSS to style the sign-up form if you do not like the themes that come with the plugin. The following selectors can be used to target the various form elements.

`
.mc4wp-form { ... } /* the form element */
.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
.mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
.mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
.mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */
`

You can add your custom CSS to your theme stylesheet or (easier) by using a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

#### How do I show a sign-up form in a pop-up?

We recommend the [Boxzilla pop-up plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/boxzilla/) for this. You can use the form shortcode in your pop-up box to show a sign-up form.

### How do I subscribe from my WooCommerce checkout form?

You can use our WooCommerce integration for that. [How to subscribe to Mailchimp from the WooCommerce checkout form](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/connect-woocommerce-store-mailchimp/).

### How to connect my WooCommerce store with Mailchimp?

You can find instructions for [connecting your WooCommerce store with Mailchimp](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/connect-woocommerce-store-mailchimp/) on our website.

#### I'm getting an "HTTP Error" when trying to connect to Mailchimp.

the "HTTP Error" type is usually because of a firewall configuration issue or outdated software on your web server.

Please contact your webhost and ask them to check the following:

- Whether remote HTTP requests to `https://api.mailchimp.com` are allowed.
- Whether cURL and the PHP-cURL extension are installed and updated to a recent version.

#### My question is not listed here.
